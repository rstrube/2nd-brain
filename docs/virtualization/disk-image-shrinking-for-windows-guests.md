# Disk Image Shrinking for Windows Guests
Before embarking on shrinking your VM disk image first perform a general cleanup of your Windows VM.

## Windows SxS Cleanup
The Windows SxS maintains an archive of windows components that have been upgraded.  Over time, this can consume a large amount of disk space.  You can run some commands to immediately wipe out all but the most recent windows components.

Using an elevated Command Prompt or Powershell, execute the following:

```powershell
Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup
```
